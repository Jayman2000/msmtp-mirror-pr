msmtp is an SMTP client.

In the default mode, it transmits a mail to an SMTP server.

To use this program with your mail user agent (MUA), create a configuration 
file with your mail account(s) and tell your MUA to call msmtp instead of 
/usr/sbin/sendmail.

Features include:
- Sendmail compatible interface (command line options and exit codes)
- Support for multiple accounts
- TLS support including client certificates
- Support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)
- Many authentication methods
- Fast SMTP implementation using command pipelining
- DSN (Delivery Status Notification) support
- SOCKS proxy support

msmtp runs on a wide variety of platforms. It needs little more than an ANSI C
compiler and Berkeley-style sockets. It does not require any additional libraries,
but it can use the following to enhance its feature set:
- GnuTLS. The GnuTLS library provides TLS support. It is highly recommended.
  OpenSSL can be used as an alternative to GnuTLS, but this is discouraged.
- GNU SASL. Using the GNU SASL library adds support for some exotic
  authentication methods. You really only need it if you want to use GSSAPI.
- GNU libidn2. On modern Linux systems with recent glibc and GnuTLS
  libraries, msmtp has automatic support for Internationalized Domain Names
  (IDN). On other systems, IDN support is available via libidn2.
